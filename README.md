# Harry Potter Trivia

A self-scoring trivia game about Harry Potter and the Wizarding World. Questions will increase in difficulty as the game progresses.
This game has 7 levels of difficulty, each with 7 questions to answer. The levels are both numbered and given a name based on a Harry Potter character whose magical skill level corresponds to the difficulty of questions in that level.
If the user is answering correctly, they will progress through the levels quickly. If the user is answering incorrectly, they will stay in the same level of difficulty longer.
At the end of the game, a new screen will appear to show the user their final score and give them a rating based on how well they did.
